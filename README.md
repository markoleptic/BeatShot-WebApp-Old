# BeatShot WebApp Old

This project is the deprecated version of [BeatShot-WebApp](https://github.com/markoleptic/BeatShot-WebApp). It uses an ExpressJS backend and a ReactJS frontend to serve static content. The new version uses NextJS to support Server Side Rendering among other features. The new structure was significant enough to warrant a new repository.
